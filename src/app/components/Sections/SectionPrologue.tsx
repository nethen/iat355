        This exploration started with one question: how do students perceive
        their quality of education within SIAT?

        As an interdisciplinary program, Simon Fraser University&apos;s (SFU)
        curriculum within their School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT)
        intends to cover a breadth of topics across design, human-computer
        interaction and media studies.

        Anecdotally, this variety of topics is intended for students to explore
        their interests and find their niche within their future industries.
        However, this may also lead to students feeling uncertain about their
        expertise and skillset.

        This is especially true for students who may be interested in pursuing
        less UX-focused roles. In an effort to better understand this landscape,
        we set out to survey fellow undergraduate students within
        SIAT&mdash;particularly looking at foundational visual design skills and
        confidence.
